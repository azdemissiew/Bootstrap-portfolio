            <p>  Extensive knowledge from bootcamp in full-stack development and result-driven Full Stack Developer with an extensive background in accounting solving functions and tackling different problems using a variety of techniques. The excellent problem-solving skills and Analytical skills that I acquire in the past helped me to become a quick learner and to perform well under pressure. 
                <br>I learned and mastered HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY and SQL. Making sure that the website that I create is responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop has become a second nature to me. It is rewarding for me to see a well functional website that I create from scratch. Getting my hands dirty with different programing languages helped me to be comfortable to further my study and to excel my expertise. I am learning NODE.JS, AJAX and REACT.JS to broaden my spectrum and develop ethical programing skills. In order to be skilled in the tech industry I will keep adding and updating myself with the most popular programing language.

                <p> <img src="images/IMG_E0425.JPG ">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of

                    the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever

                    since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type

                    specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic

                    typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>

                <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when

                    looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal

                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like

                    readable EnglishThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority

                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even

                    slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there

                    isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>
